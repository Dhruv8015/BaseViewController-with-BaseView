# BaseViewController-with-BaseView
In software development we all know that we have to reuse code as per as requirement 
so we have to utilise our code with less efort
i ll show you one demo on that
first make one viewcontroller of baseviewcontroller
then make one view of base view
initialize this view in controller
we can use this view in another controller too ...thats the main purpose of baseview
In storyboard or in one viewcontroller have its own view ..we all know that 
if we have work in own's view,then it will not use for another controller so we can implement on baseview & use it another times with simple initialize.
